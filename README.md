### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️ My name is Lennart and I am a Software Engineer

🛅 I am currently working at [Bounce](https://usebounce.com/) in Lisbon, Portugal

🔨 I do have experience in working with various programming languages, especially Kotlin, Go, and Dart.

🐳 Also, I know my way around Docker, AWS (e.g. ECS, Lambda) CI/CD and most XP practices.

📚 At the moment, I am mainly improving my JavaScript and TypeScript skills, but I am always keen to learn new things.

🏝 Most repos on here are fairly outdated and created when I was in university, so don't expect anything crazy.

🤓 I would be super interested to start contributing to open source software more in the future!

🤙 Feel free to hit me up!
