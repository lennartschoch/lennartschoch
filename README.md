### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️ My name is Lennart and I am a Software Engineer

🚗 I am currently working at Volkswagen Digital Solutions in Lisbon, Portugal

🔨 I do have experience in working in various programming languages, including Kotlin, Go, and Dart.

🐳 Also, I know my way around Docker, AWS (e.g. ECS, Lambda) CI/CD and most XP practices.

📚 I am currently mainly improving my JavaScript and TypeScript skills, but I am always keen to learn new things.

🤙 Feel free to hit me up!
